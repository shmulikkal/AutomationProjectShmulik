    <h2 style="color: black; text-align:center">Technological Progress - The Past, the Present and the future</h2>
    <div class="center">
        <p>
            The first years of modern technology were ground-breaking in their own way but, back then, nobody knew just how revolutionary these basic steps were going to be for the economy. To begin with, a single computer would require huge hardware in order to complete the simplest of tasks, computer scientists like Charles Babbage – inventor of the first mechanical computer – were the only ones who really knew how to work the technology.
            Just like the three ghosts visited Scrooge on Christmas Eve, we’re about the visit the technology industry and review their past, analyse their present and predict the future.<br>
        </p>

        <b style="color: black; text-align:center">Past</b><br>
        <p>
			The first years of modern technology were ground-breaking in their own way but, back then, nobody knew just how revolutionary these basic steps were going to be for the economy. To begin with, a single computer would require huge hardware in order to complete the simplest of tasks, computer scientists like Charles Babbage – inventor of the first mechanical computer – were the only ones who really knew how to work the technology.<br>
            The idea of the internet wasn’t actually all that new by the time it was created, now-famous inventor, Nikola Tesla actually toyed with the idea of a world wireless system back in the early 1900s. From there, various technology pioneers and engineers worked on the theory to make it into a reality and in 1989, with the help of Tim Berners-Lee, the internet took its first recognisable form – the World Wide Web.<br>
            As computing and software has developed the technology industry became more relevant across other sectors and cross overs began to form. Instead of manual labour on factory lines, machines came along which improved their processes. Equally, computers became more commercialised and businesses and larger corporations started to see how they could be utilised in order to help or create new business.<br>
        </p>

        <b style="color: black; text-align:center">Present</b><br>
        <p>
            Over the years, technology has continued to develop, and it’s now fully integrated into our everyday life and Big Tech leading the business market. In the first days of the internet, no one could have predicted that it would have evolved to the point it is now. Technology giants range from hardware to software, with companies like Facebook, Apple, Microsoft and Google at the very centre of the average human’s life.<br>
            What we have seen over recent years and especially in the past 12 months is how modernisation due to innovative technologies are affecting the current workforce. There are varied predictions on what will happen to the jobs of the future and companies are currently busy preparing themselves for the potential restructuring that is just around the corner.<br>
            Of course, there have also been new jobs created by technology, so businesses are now focusing on the skills the next generation needs in order to meet the new standards of work the will soon be implemented. This is the tech industry’s opportunity to use the closure of their skills gap to also help attract new and diverse talent. A prime example of how this is already being approached is the various competitions and schemes that are being offered to the younger generation like the Ultimate STEM Challenge and CISCO Little Big Figures.<br>
            </p>

            <b style="color: black; text-align:center">Future</b><br>
        <p>
            The future is certainly looking promising for technology and even though statistics have shown that 30 per cent of jobs across the UK could be at risk because of automation, it’s important to note that when basic technology was introduced into the business world, people weren’t unemployed, their jobs just evolved.<br>
            What we expect to see in the near future is a huge focus on technology skills being introduced from a young age and the workforce to have opportunities to upskill in preparation for the technological takeover. In addition to this, innovative technologies will continue to be introduced to help tackle other factors of society that need to be addressed. A prime example of this is the increase in environmental technology. Not only will the creation of this technology bring new jobs across the globe but it’s equally helping the world around us.<br>
            In 2020, and the years after, technology will continue to rise in popularity and the opportunities that come along with it grow in unison. If the past, present and future of technology is anything to reflect on, it’s just how much a single element can revolutionise every industry within the global economy. Workers should look to this and feel motivated to improve upon their technological skills as the future is certainly looking technical.<br>

    <h2 style="color:black;text-align:center">Technological Progress - Pros & Cons</h2>
    <h3 style="color:black;text-align:center">Pros of technological progress</h3>
    <div class="center">
        <p>
            Thanks to technological progress humans live longer and much more comfortable lives. The <b>medical advancements</b> have helped us develop vaccines and treatment for diseases which were previously lethal. Giving birth is not as dangerous as it used to be. Technological progress has allowed develop new techniques for diagnosis and mitigation of diseases and other conditions. Scientific research has improved our understanding of nutrition and contributed to healthier lifestyles.<br>
            Technology has allowed humans to <b>travel faster</b> and trade goods all over the world. Crossing the Atlantic was historically an adventure that would take weeks. Now in just a few hours you can travel from New York to London or Paris. Thanks to technology we can have holidays in remote locations and capture these moments through pictures. We can now buy and consume goods produced far away. In the same supermarket you can find French cheeses, South African wines, Spanish olive oils, Brazilian coffees, and Japanese fish.<br>
            Without technology we would still be nomads hunting and gathering fruits and vegetables. <b>Industrial societies</b> heavily rely on technological progress. We can feed a fast growing world population thanks to the continuous innovation in production techniques. New inventions help foster the production, storage, treatment and transportation of goods. Societies which invest in research and development have a competitive edge and thrive. The people in technologically advanced societies live more comfortable lives.<br>
            <b>Genetically modified foods (GMO)</b> may help fight hunger and ensure that world population continues to be fed. Genetic modification techniques contribute to produce more food and to maintain agricultural production at affordable prices.<br>
            <b>The Internet, computers and mobile phones</b> illustrate the role of technology in improving society. Efficiency has skyrocketed thanks to these inventions. Our work and social lives have been transformed. People can now work from home and collaborate with teams located in other towns, countries or even continents. We can keep a fluid communication and relationship with friends and family living abroad. News of events cross the globe in seconds. Social netwoks such as facebook and twitter are extremely useful.<br> Thanks to technology grandparents get to see and chat with their grandchildren much more often. People today get to meet others sharing similar hobbies or interests.<br>
            Thanks to new technologies, alternative <b>forms of entertainment and art</b> have developed during the last century. Photography, radio, movies, television shows, music and video games occupy a central spot in people's lives. There are new forms of entertainment at our doorstep, such as virtual reality. Additionally, IT is facilitating the work of creators and help increase the quality of entertainment.<br>
            The importance of technology in the delopment of <b>renewable energies</b> is evident. Without technological progress it would be difficult to envisage a green future in which the problem of climate change could be kept under control. Scientific advancements are making electric cars more affordable and enhancing the effectiveness and efficiency of solar and eolic energy, as well as that hydropower.
        </p>



        <h3 style="color:black;text-align:center">Cons of technological progress</h3>
        <p>
            Technology is altering our lifestyle and will alter the <b>cognitive and social development</b> of current and future generations. There are many different ways in which the evolution of technology and society are connected. Technological innovation has changed our lives. Computers, smartphones and the internet have strongly affected how we interact with other people. Many claim that they are dehumanizing our lives and making us more solitary people. Technology may be also facilitating cultural colonialism and reducing diversity. Today, children play less with other children and spend much of their time watching videos in their tablets and playing video games. People are doing less physical exercise than their ancestors. We are becoming increasingly detached from nature and attached to technological gadgets.<br>
            <b>Human cloning</b> technology is a reality and in addition to some obvious advantages, human cloning brings some risks. For instance it could create worrisome divides in society between those genetically divided to be smarter or physically more attractive and the rest. Human cloning will be difficult to regulate and will bring concerns regarding its interference with nature and religious beliefs.<br>
            <b>Weaponization of viruses</b>. For instance, viruses such as Ebola or AIDS could be transformed into a virus that could be transmitted through the air. This could endanger or even cause the extinction of the the human race. Lifeforms can be created through genetic manipulation.<br> With techonological progress the techniques to create or manipulate lifeforms will be increasingly accessible to us. Potentially even high school children will be able to create life in science experiments. Genomes of infectious diseases will be available to download from the internet. Terrorists, psychopaths and other criminals will have the capacity to use genetic manipulation to harm or threaten others.<br>
            Similarly, scientific experimentation might create enormous dangers for society. <b>Risky experiments may go wrongs</b>. Researchers are currently mutating microorganism in order to find cures to diseases. By accident these diseases could escape the laboratory and spread. Experiments with particle accelerators, such as the Large Hadron Collider, entail some serious risks. Some scientists even claimed that humans could create a black hole that could destroy Earth.<br>
            <b>Enrichment of uranium</b> is becoming an increasingly cheaper process. Traditionally the infrastructure required to produce nuclear power and build <b>nuclear bombs</b> was extremely expensive. Thanks to technological progress and the use of laser beams to separate U-235 and U-238, in the not so distant future, people might be able to enrich uranium home. Nuclear weapons in the hands of the wrong organizations or individuals could create enormous unrest in the world population and a serious security threat.<br>
            Technological progress is to be blamed for the negative effects of global warming and <b>climate change</b>. The role of technology fostering economic progress is difficult to deny. However, at the same time the generation of enegy necessary to the increased production and transportation of goods, for instance through combustion engines and thermoelectric generators, has produced an increased in the emission and concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.<br>
            Technology can be also used as an <b>undesirable tool of control</b>. For instance, scientists are working to develop brain scanning machines which could allow read a person's thoughts. This would have great benefits as could allow people with disabilities or people having suffered brain damage to communicate. Moreover if through a magnetic resoncance we could enquire criminals and terrorist we could also prevent harm for society. Similarly, thanks to advanced IT, it is possible to analyse the communications of millions of people and identify potential crimes and wrongdoers. Unfortunately, there is a very real possibility that technology will end up used by some governments in a draconian way. A dystopian future where people are constantly inquisitorially surveilled by a <b>Big Brother</b> as in Orwell's science fiction classic 1984.

    <h2 style="color:black;text-align:center">How Many Jobs Do Robots Really Replace?</h2> <!--  כותרת  -->
    <div class="center">

        <p>
            In many parts of the U.S., robots have been replacing workers over the last few decades.
            But to what extent, really? Some technologists have forecast that automation will lead to a future without work, while other observers have been more skeptical about such scenarios.
            Now a study co-authored by an MIT professor puts firm numbers on the trend, finding a very real impact — although one that falls well short of a robot takeover.
            The study also finds that in the U.S., the impact of robots varies widely by industry and region, and may play a notable role in exacerbating income inequality.

            “We find fairly major negative employment effects,” MIT economist Daron Acemoglu says, although he notes that the impact of the trend can be overstated.
            From 1990 to 2007, the study shows, adding one additional robot per 1,000 workers reduced the national employment-to-population ratio by about 0.2 percent, with some areas of the U.S. affected far more than others.
            This means each additional robot added in manufacturing replaced about 3.3 workers nationally, on average.
            That increased use of robots in the workplace also lowered wages by roughly 0.4 percent during the same time period.
            We find negative wage effects, that workers are losing in terms of real wages in more affected areas, because robots are pretty good at competing against them,” Acemoglu says.
            The paper, “Robots and Jobs: Evidence from U.S. Labor Markets,” appears in advance online form in the Journal of Political Economy.
            The authors are Acemoglu and Pascual Restrepo PhD ’16, an assistant professor of economics at Boston University.

        From: <a href="https://news.mit.edu/2020/how-many-jobs-robots-replace-0504"> https://news.mit.edu/2020/how-many-jobs-robots-replace-0504</a>

    <h3 style="color:black;text-align:center">Displaced In Detroit</h3>    <!-- תת כותרת  -->
    <div class="center">
        <p>
            To conduct the study, Acemoglu and Restrepo used data on 19 industries, compiled by the International Federation of Robotics (IFR), a Frankfurt-based industry group that keeps detailed statistics on robot deployments worldwide.
            The scholars combined that with U.S.-based data on population, employment, business, and wages, from the U.S. Census Bureau, the Bureau of Economic Analysis, and the Bureau of Labor Statistics, among other sources.<br>
            The researchers also compared robot deployment in the U.S. to that of other countries, finding it lags behind that of Europe. From 1993 to 2007,<br> U.S. firms actually did introduce almost exactly one new robot per 1,000 workers; in Europe, firms introduced 1.6 new robots per 1,000 workers.
            “Even though the U.S. is a technologically very advanced economy, in terms of industrial robots’ production and usage and innovation, it’s behind many other advanced economies,” Acemoglu says.<br>
            In the U.S., four manufacturing industries account for 70 percent of robots: automakers (38 percent of robots in use), electronics (15 percent), the plastics and chemical industry (10 percent), and metals manufacturers (7 percent).<br>
            Across the U.S., the study analyzed the impact of robots in 722 commuting zones in the continental U.S. — essentially metropolitan areas — and found considerable geographic variation in how intensively robots are utilized<br>.
            Given industry trends in robot deployment, the area of the country most affected is the seat of the automobile industry.
            Michigan has the highest concentration of robots in the workplace, with employment in Detroit, Lansing, and Saginaw affected more than anywhere else in the country.
            “Different industries have different footprints in different places in the U.S.,” Acemoglu observes. “The place where the robot issue is most apparent is Detroit.
            Whatever happens to automobile manufacturing has a much greater impact on the Detroit area [than elsewhere].”
            In commuting zones where robots were added to the workforce, each robot replaces about 6.6 jobs locally, the researchers found.
            However, in a subtle twist, adding robots in manufacturing benefits people in other industries and other areas of the country — by lowering the cost of goods, among other things.
            These national economic benefits are the reason the researchers calculated that adding one robot replaces 3.3 jobs for the country as a whole.
        </p>
    </div>
    <h3 style="color:Black;text-align:center">The Inequality Issue</h3>  <!-- תת כותרת  -->
    <div class="center">
        <p>
            In conducting the study, Acemoglu and Restrepo went to considerable lengths to see if the employment trends in robot-heavy areas might have been caused by other factors, such as trade policy, but they found no complicating empirical effects.
            The study does suggest, however, that robots have a direct influence on income inequality.
            The manufacturing jobs they replace come from parts of the workforce without many other good employment options; as a result, there is a direct connection between automation in robot-using industries and sagging incomes among blue-collar workers.
            “There are major distributional implications,” Acemoglu says. When robots are added to manufacturing plants, “The burden falls on the low-skill and especially middle-skill workers.
            That’s really an important part of our overall research [on robots], that automation actually is a much bigger part of the technological factors that have contributed to rising inequality over the last 30 years.”
            So while claims about machines wiping out human work entirely may be overstated, the research by Acemoglu and Restrepo shows that the robot effect is a very real one in manufacturing, with significant social implications.
            “It certainly won’t give any support to those who think robots are going to take all of our jobs,” Acemoglu says.
            “But it does imply that automation is a real force to be grappled with.”

    <h2 style="color:black;text-align:center"> A Short History Of ChatGPT: How We Got To Where We Are Today</h2>  <!--  כותרת  -->
    <div class="center">
        <p>
            Picture an AI that truly speaks your language — and not just your words and syntax. Imagine an AI that understands context, nuance, and even humor.<br>
            This is no longer just a futuristic concept — it's the reality of ChatGPT.<br>
            ChatGPT is an artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot built on top of OpenAI's foundational large language models (LLMs) like GPT-4 and its predecessors.<br>
            This chatbot has redefined the standards of artificial intelligence, proving that machines can indeed “learn” the complexities of human language and interaction<br>
            Let’s delve into the fascinating history of ChatGPT, charting its evolution from its launch to its present-day capabilities.<br>
            OpenAI released an early demo of ChatGPT on November 30, 2022, and the chatbot quickly went viral on social media as users shared examples of what it could do.<br>
            Stories and samples included everything from travel planning to writing fables to code computer programs.<br>
            Within five days, the chatbot had attracted over one million users.<br>
            OpenAI was founded in December 2015 by Sam Altman, Greg Brockman, Elon Musk, Ilya Sutskever, Wojciech Zaremba, and John Schulman.<br>
            The founding team combined their diverse expertise in technology entrepreneurship, machine learning, and software engineering to create an organization focused <br>on advancing artificial intelligence in a way that benefits humanity.
            Elon Musk is no longer involved in OpenAI,<br> and Sam Altman is the current CEO of the organization.
            OpenAI is currently valued at $29 billion, and the company has raised a total of $11.3B in funding over seven rounds so far.<br>
            In January, microsoft expanded its long-term partnership with Open AI and announced a multibillion-dollar investment to accelerate AI breakthroughs worldwide.

    <h3 style="color:black;text-align:center"> GPT’s Major Milestones </h3>     <!-- תת כותרת  -->
    <div class="center">
        <p>
            The journey of ChatGPT has been marked by continual advancements, each version building upon previous tools.<br>
            GPT-1, the model that was introduced in June 2018, was the first iteration of the GPT (generative pre-trained transformer) series and consisted of 117 million parameters.
            This set the foundational architecture for ChatGPT as we know it today.
            GPT-1 demonstrated the power of unsupervised learning in language understanding tasks, using books as training data to predict the next word in a sentence.<br>
            GPT-2, which was released in February 2019, represented a significant upgrade with 1.5 billion parameters.
            It showcased a dramatic improvement in text generation capabilities and produced coherent, multi-paragraph text.
            But due to its potential misuse, GPT-2 wasn't initially released to the public.
            The model was eventually launched in November 2019 after OpenAI conducted a staged rollout to study and mitigate potential risks.<br>
            GPT-3 was a huge leap forward in June 2020. This model was trained on a staggering 175 billion parameters.
            Its advanced text-generation capabilities led to widespread use in various applications, from drafting emails and writing articles to creating poetry and even generating programming code.
            It also demonstrated an ability to answer factual questions and translate between languages.
            When GPT-3 launched, it marked a pivotal moment when the world started acknowledging this groundbreaking technology.
            Although the models had been in existence for a few years, it was with GPT-3 that individuals had the opportunity to interact with ChatGPT directly, ask it questions, and receive comprehensive and practical responses.
            When people were able to interact directly with the LLM like this, it became clear just how impactful this technology would become.<br>
            GPT-4, the latest iteration, continues this trend of exponential improvement, with changes like:
            Improved model alignment — the ability to follow user intention Lower likelihood of generating offensive or dangerous output Increased factual accuracy
            Better steerability — the ability to change behavior according to user reques Internet connectivity – the latest feature includes the ability to search the Internet in real-time
            Each milestone brings us closer to a future where AI seamlessly integrates into our daily lives, enhancing our productivity, creativity, and communication.
